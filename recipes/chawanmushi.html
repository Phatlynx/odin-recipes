<h3>Japanese Chawan Mushi</h3>
<p>
  Chawanmushi is an egg custard dish in Japanese cuisine. Unlike many other
  custards, it is usually eaten as a dish in a meal, as chawanmushi contains
  savory rather than sweet ingredients.

<ul>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup cooled chicken or fish stock</li>
  <li>1 dash sake</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon soy sauce</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped cooked chicken breast meat</li>
  <li>1 shiitake mushroom, sliced into strips</li>
  <li>2 sprigs fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
</ul>

    In a medium bowl, whisk eggs gently while slowly pouring in the chicken
    stock, sake, and soy sauce. Divide the mushroom and chicken evenly between
    two small tea cups. Pour the egg mixture into each cup until filled.

    Bring about 1 inch of water to a boil in a steamer or saucepan. Reduce heat
    to a simmer, and place cups into the steamer. Cover, and steam for 12
    minutes, or until egg is firm but soft and silky like tofu. Garnish each cup
    with a sprig of parsley, and serve.
