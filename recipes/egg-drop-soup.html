<h3>Chinese Egg Drop Soup</h3>
<p>
  One of the classic soups in Chinese households, the name “Egg Drop” comes from
  how the soup is made—dropping raw egg into hot soup.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
  <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/8 teaspoon sugar</li>
  <li>▢1/8 teaspoon white pepper</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>1 scallion</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in the sesame
    oil, salt, sugar, and white pepper. Add in the turmeric or 5 drops of yellow
    food coloring, if using. This will give the soup that rich restaurant-style
    yellow color, but it is optional. Taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning
    if needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next add the cornstarch and water mixture. Make sure the cornstarch and
    water is mixed well, as the cornstarch settles very quickly. Stir the soup
    continuously as you drizzle in the slurry, or you'll get clumps of cooked
    starch in your soup. Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or
    thinner soup. You can also add the starch in a couple small batches, let the
    soup simmer for a couple of minutes, then check to see if the consistency is
    to your liking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now we're ready for the most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls for
    the egg to be lightly beaten, which results in both white and yellow egg
    swirls. The speed at which you stir the soup when adding the egg also
    determines whether you get large “egg flowers” or small egg flowers (i.e.
    swirly bits of egg). Use a ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion, and
    slowly drizzle in the egg until you have added it all.
